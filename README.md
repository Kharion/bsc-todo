Repository for test assigment showcase

This is readme for .BSC Test assignment.

The project uses Cocoapods. Open project with BSC Todo.xcworkspace file. If you don't have cocoapods installed install cocoapods first, then run pod --install in your project directory.

This project does some calls to external server.

Run app in simulator. At the beginning all data from server should be downloaded via async call. Table view gets populated automatically. In case of some networking error user can use swipe down action to try and make another atempt in populating the Table View.
